+ Tragedy and catharsis in tango
  stop, close your eyes
  Think about your emotions, be aware of the negative ones.
  Try to localize these emotions within your body
  concentrate them
  let them expand along your body, feel them in the tension of your muscles and under your skin
  Dance! Let them come out from your movements
