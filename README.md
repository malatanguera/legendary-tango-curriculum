Legendary Tango Curriculum
==========================

This is a git-flavoured-markdown collection of notes for teaching
Argentinean tango.

Please note that the present work does not aim at being the ultimate
resource for Argentinean tango: there is a different tango for each
person who teaches and dances it, and its culture and its move have
been very fluid in the century of its existence, and continue to
change and evolve now.

Keep and open mind, this is only a voice among many, where I hope
you will be able to find inspiration to find your own way to dance.


Theory
======

# First class
+ My teaching style: Teaching how vs teaching what
+ Get a feel for it: Hug and move together
+ Connecting through the embrace: How to move together
+ Starting with the same weight
+ Stepping in your partner's step


# Chest rotation & salida
+ Lead chest rotation: Follower with hands on Leader's shoulders
+ Lead chest rotation: Double pivot Waist turns twice as much as the chest
+ Salida from double pivot
+ Description of salida
+ Salida from side step
+ Salida from walk
+ Keep the embrace solid!


# Rebote
+ Lead sidestep around leader
+ Rebote
+ Salida through rebote
+ Social


# Parada
* Repeat side step left and right, then L stands and brings a side step (ie: around herself).
* L brings alternate left/right side step, then sanguicito
* From sanguicito, L stands, brings side step
* Explain parada: interrupting F leg before it moves
* Paradas
  - On a single side step
  - On ocho, parallela y crusada
* Breaking the obvious


# Combinations
+ Explanation: "You have to come up with your own sequence"
+ Refresh rebote
+ Combination: From side step to rebote
+ Refresh salida
+ Combination: From salida to rebote
+ Combination: From rebote to salida


# Crusado and parallelo
TODO: break
* Rebote with weight change
* Crusado walk
* "Crusado" vs "Parallelo"

* Switches:
  - Rebote (done already)
  - Side step
  - Half step

* Left-Right vs Open-Close
* Ocho is in Crusado
* Exercise: follower calls left/right/open/close aloud


# Ochos
TODO: break
* Dissociation: frees the leg to move everywhere without impacting the connection with the partner
* Dissociate chest and waist
* Leader brings pivot, Follower keeps body rigid.
* Bring chest rotation: Follower with hands on Leader's shoulders
* Bring chest rotation: Leader does not use right hand
* Bring pivot, waist rotates twice as much as chest
* Ocho a tras

? Giro


# Tecnica
TODO: break

* Why do we learn to write

* Details:
  - Feet close
  - Weight between balls and toes
  - Loose knees
  - Vertical skewer
  - Stretch abs
  - Shoulders and elbows fall down

* Exercise: weight change, 100% vs 0%.

* Execise: waist-leg dissociation
  NOTE: Adornos, importance of free foot.

* Exercise: Planeos

* Throwing the foot, collecting the foot

* Feeling:
  - Queens and kings
  - Uncompromising
  - Solid, without being rigid
  - There is a direction to your movements, and that direction is your partner

* Exercise: Walking with a partner

# Lead & Connection Exercises

+ Single hand embrace

Either open side or closed side


+ No Embrace

Lead and follow by sight alone, keep eyes on partner's chest


+ Elbow-length embrace

Follower with arms together, both forearms on leader's chest, leader's arms on follower's shoulders


+ Symmetric close embrace

Leader uses no hands; follower keeps both hands on leader's shoulders


+ Focus on feeling the partner's body as an extension of one's own.

These are just note drafts, need to be tried, evaluated and if they are good, polished.


# Figures & Combinations
+ Sacada on sidestep from gancho, crusado y parallelo




# Connection
Switch continuously from side step to weight change



# Musicality

+ Learn to wait and to be slow
+ Make the partner feel the music through your bodies
+ Reverse movement

## Dancing alone
+ Feeling the music below the skin (track: Felino)
+ Redirect the flow of your physical sensation along the music to create movement
+ Focusing on the instrument that marks our movements (track: Desde el Alma)
+ Dance with the hand, like an orchestra director

## Dancing with a partner
+ Follower names aloud the instrument the leader is using (track: Ahora no me conosces)
+ Dance with the hand

## Mindset
+ Don't rush to show off: when we feel that need, it's a signal that are doing something wrong
+ Bring back the attention on the partner's body

# Social Dancing Exercise

+ Confined space



# Technique Exercises

## Walk
+ Step forward, weight change, step backwards, weight change
+ Open forward/side/back repeat, single, then with music

Work in progress
================

# Musicality
This is a class about tragedy

tango was created by depserate people, longing for home, for their families

Why do people like tragedies and dramas?
Because it's cathartic

It is not a matter of technical skill:
even when you are just doing a sidestep, there is a difference in just going through the movements AND expressing your current feeling through your muscles, letting this intensity drive you in the movement.
Be with your partner, and you can be sure that your partner will feel it.

* meditation, start to work on our awaareness
Dance, focusing on the partner's body through yours
When you lose the focus, think that it is ok, and gently bring it back

* stop, close your eyes
Think about your emotions, be aware of the negative ones.
Try to localize these emotions within your body
concentrate them
let them expand along your body, feel them in the tension of your muscles and under your skin
Dance! Let them come out from your movements

also, your body moves only if your partner's body moves, regardless of whether you are leading or following
