Legendary Tango Curriculum
==========================

This is a git-flavoured-markdown collection of notes for teaching
Argentinean tango.

Please note that the present work does not aim at being the ultimate
resource for Argentinean tango: there is a different tango for each
person who teaches and dances it, and its culture and its move have
been very fluid in the century of its existence, and continue to
change and evolve now.

Keep and open mind, this is only a voice among many, where I hope
you will be able to find inspiration to find your own way to dance.
