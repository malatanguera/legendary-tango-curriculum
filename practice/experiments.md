### Musicality
This is a class about tragedy

tango was created by depserate people, longing for home, for their families

Why do people like tragedies and dramas?
Because it's cathartic

It is not a matter of technical skill:
even when you are just doing a sidestep, there is a difference in just going through the movements AND expressing your current feeling through your muscles, letting this intensity drive you in the movement.
Be with your partner, and you can be sure that your partner will feel it.

* meditation, start to work on our awaareness
Dance, focusing on the partner's body through yours
When you lose the focus, think that it is ok, and gently bring it back

* stop, close your eyes
Think about your emotions, be aware of the negative ones.
Try to localize these emotions within your body
concentrate them
let them expand along your body, feel them in the tension of your muscles and under your skin
Dance! Let them come out from your movements

also, your body moves only if your partner's body moves, regardless of whether you are leading or following
