# Musicality

+ Learn to wait and to be slow
+ Make the partner feel the music through your bodies
+ Reverse movement

## Dancing alone
+ Feeling the music below the skin (track: Felino)
+ Redirect the flow of your physical sensation along the music to create movement
+ Focusing on the instrument that marks our movements (track: Desde el Alma)
+ Dance with the hand, like an orchestra director

## Dancing with a partner
+ Follower names aloud the instrument the leader is using (track: Ahora no me conosces)
+ Dance with the hand

## Mindset
+ Don't rush to show off: when we feel that need, it's a signal that are doing something wrong
+ Bring back the attention on the partner's body
